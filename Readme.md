The exercises are attached to this repository in accordance with the following instructions:

## Exercise 1:
This exercise consists of a production scheduling problem in which tasks have different release times and due dates. Additionally, the setup times between tasks are variable. 
That makes this problem analogous to the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows.
A literature review on metaheuristic applications to this type of problem indicates that Iterated Local Search and Variable Neighborhood Search are the approaches with the highest number of occurrences, and they were therefore selected for this problem.

## Exercise 2:
In this second exercise, vehicles must be allocated on both sides of a street in such a way as to minimize the space used on that street. 
This makes the problem analogous to a production scheduling problem in parallel machine environments aimed at minimizing the makespan, which is a well-known problem.
The problem was modeled using the Assignment approach, in which a binary variable is defined and assigned the value 1 if task j is scheduled on machine k, and 0 otherwise.
